MiniBlog MVC
```
This a draft of my programming blog. Right now it's being built with .Net Core MVC, but it will be changed to static content and deployed with Github Pages. <br />
The idea is to create a blog with tiny snippets of code and description of the problems I've encountered while writing code. <br />
Posts will not cover full issue, just tiny description how to code it in the beginning. <br />
Website is created with SCSS and .Net Core with C#.
